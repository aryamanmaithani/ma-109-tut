\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Week 1}
    Now, we digress a bit to see what $\mathbb{R}$ and completeness really means.

    It is okay if you don't understand every single thing. It is more or less for you to know ``okay, whatever we say works'' even if you don't know the exact details why.
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Week 1}
    What is $\mathbb{R}?$ \uncover<2->{Well, all one really needs is to know the following two slides about $\mathbb{R}.$ }

    \uncover<3->{$\mathbb{R}$ is a field. }\uncover<4->{This means that the familiar properties of addition/multiplication are true. }\uncover<5->{(Commutativity, associativity, existence of identity, inverses, and distributivity.) }

    \uncover<6->{$\mathbb{R}$ is ordered. }\uncover<7->{There is a binary operation $\le$ on $\mathbb{R}$ which is }\uncover<8->{reflexive, }\uncover<9->{anti-symmetric, }\uncover<10->{transitive, }\uncover<11->{\emph{and any two elements can be compared.} }

    \uncover<12->{$\mathbb{R}$ is an ordered field. }\uncover<13->{All this means is that there is an order which is actually compatible with $+$ and $\cdot.$ }\uncover<14->{What does this mean? }

    \uncover<15->{$x < y \implies x + z < y + z$ for all $x, y, z \in \mathbb{R},$}\\
    \uncover<16->{$x < y \implies x \cdot z < y \cdot z$ for all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ and $z \in \mathbb{R}_{> 0}.$ }
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Week 1}
    Note that all the properties earlier are also satisfied by $\mathbb{Q}.$ Here's what sets $\mathbb{R}$ apart:

    \uncover<2->{
    \begin{tcolorbox}
        $\mathbb{R}$ is complete.
    \end{tcolorbox} }

    \uncover<3->{There's another way of defining completeness of $\mathbb{R},$ which coincides with the usual. }\uncover<4->{It is the following: }
    \uncover<5->{\begin{tcolorbox}
        Every non-empty subset of $\mathbb{R}$\uncover<6->{ which is bounded above }\uncover<7->{has a least upper bound. }
    \end{tcolorbox} }
    \uncover<8->{{\color{red}The} least upper bound is called \emph{supremum.} }

    \uncover<9->{Note that \textbf{neither} of the above grey boxes is true if we replace $\mathbb{R}$ by $\mathbb{Q}.$ }
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Week 1}
    What one must really ask at this point is: \uncover<2->{how do we know that $\mathbb{R}$ exists? }

    \uncover<3->{That is, how do we know that there is some set $\mathbb{R}$ }\uncover<4->{with some operations $+, \cdot$ }\uncover<5->{and binary relation $<$ }\uncover<6->{which satisfies all the listed properties? }

    \uncover<7->{That is what I refer to as a non-trivial part. }\uncover<8->{It can be done but is not useful to us at the moment. }
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Week 1}
    Back to sequences now.

    \begin{defn}[Monotonically increasing sequences]
        \uncover<2->{A sequence $(a_n)$ is said to be \emph{monotonically increasing} }\uncover<3->{if
        \begin{equation*} 
            a_{n + 1} \ge a_n
        \end{equation*} }\uncover<4->{for all $n \in \mathbb{N}.$ }
    \end{defn}
    \uncover<5->{Similarly, one defines a monotonically decreasing sequence. }\uncover<6->{A sequence is said to be monotonic if it is either monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing. }
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Week 1}
    \uncover<1->{\begin{defn}[Eventually monotonically increasing sequences]
        \uncover<2->{A sequence $(a_n)$ is said to be \emph{eventually monotonically increasing} }\uncover<3->{if there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that }\uncover<4->{
        \begin{equation*} 
            a_{n + 1} \ge a_n
        \end{equation*} }\uncover<5->{for all $n \ge N.$ }
    \end{defn} }
    \vspace{-3mm}
    \uncover<6->{As earlier, we can define eventually monotonically decreasing sequences and simply, eventually monotonic sequences. }

    \uncover<7->{\begin{thm}[]
        An eventually monotonic sequence {\color{red}in $\mathbb{R}$} which is bounded converges {\color{red}in $\mathbb{R}$}.
    \end{thm} }
    \uncover<8->{Again, the above is not true if we take $\mathbb{Q}$ instead of $\mathbb{R}.$ }\uncover<9->{The $\pi$ sequence shows this. }\uncover<10->{In fact, the above is really a consequence of completeness. }
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Week 1}
    We also saw series in the lectures. There's nothing much to be said about it. \uncover<2->{(As far as this course is concerned.) }\uncover<3->{In reality, there is a lot more to be said about series and various tests for seeing if a series converges. }\uncover<4->{Some of you will see this in future courses like MA 205. }\uncover<5->{Those taking a minor in Mathematics will also come across it in MA 403. }\uncover<6->{Of course, the ones in the Mathematics department will also see it in various courses. }

    \uncover<7->{For us, all we need to know is that convergence of a series is just the convergence of the \underline{sequence} of its \emph{partial sums.} }\uncover<8->{Thus, we are back in the case where we study sequences! }
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Week 1}
    We then moved on to the definition of limits of functions defined on intervals.

    \uncover<2->{For the remainder, we fix $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ }\uncover<3->{such that $a < b.$ }\uncover<4->{(Just to recall, $\infty$ is not an element of $\mathbb{R}.$) }

    \uncover<5->{\begin{defn}[Limit]
        Let $f:(a, b) \to \mathbb{R}$ be a function. \uncover<6->{Let $x_0 \in {\color{red}[}a, b{\color{red}]}$ }\uncover<7->{and $l {\color{red}\;\in \mathbb{R}}.$ }\uncover<8->{Then, we write
        \begin{equation*} 
            \lim_{x\to x_0}f(x) = l
        \end{equation*} }\uncover<9->{if for every $\epsilon > 0,$ }\uncover<10->{there exists $\delta > 0$ }\uncover<11->{such that }\uncover<12->{
        \begin{equation*} 
            |f(x) - l| < \epsilon
        \end{equation*} }\uncover<13->{for all ${\color{red}x \in (a, b)}$ }\uncover<14->{such that ${\color{red}0 < }|x - x_0| < \delta.$ }
    \end{defn} }
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Week 1}
    Note in the above that we can still talk about limits at points at which is the function is \emph{not} defined.

    \uncover<2->{If the thing in the previous slide does happen, }\uncover<3->{then we say that $f(x)$ tends to $l$ as $x$ tends to $x_0.$ }\uncover<4->{Or that $f$ has a limit $l$ at $x_0.$ }

    \uncover<5->{If no such $l$ exists, then we say that $f$ does not have any limit at $x_0.$ }
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Week 1}
    We then also defined limit at $\pm\infty.$

    \begin{defn}[Limit at $\infty$]
        \uncover<2->{Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ be a set which is not bounded above. }\uncover<3->{Let $f:A\to\mathbb{R}$ be a function }\uncover<4->{and let $l \in \mathbb{R}.$ }\uncover<5->{We say
        \begin{equation*} 
            \lim_{x\to \infty}f(x) = l
        \end{equation*} }\uncover<6->{if for every $\epsilon > 0,$ }\uncover<7->{there exists $X \in \mathbb{R}$ such that }\uncover<8->{
        \begin{equation*} 
            |f(x) - L| < \epsilon
        \end{equation*} }\uncover<9->{for all {\color{red} $x \in A$} }\uncover<10->{such that $x > X.$ } 
    \end{defn}
    \uncover<11->{Similarly, we have the limit at $-\infty.$ }

\begin{frame}{Week 2}
    Last week, we had ended on limits. Today, we \uncover<2->{\emph{continue} }\uncover<3->{with }\uncover<4->{\emph{continuity}. }\uncover<5>{Ba-dum-tss. }

    \uncover<6->{This is quite simple, using whatever we've already seen. }
    \uncover<7->{\begin{defn}[Continuity]
        If $f:[a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is a function \uncover<8->{and $c \in [a, b],$ }\uncover<9->{then $f$ is said to be }\uncover<10->{\emph{continuous at the point $c$} }\uncover<11->{if (and only if)
        \begin{equation*} 
            \lim_{x\to c}f(x) = f(c).
        \end{equation*} } 
    \end{defn} }
    \uncover<12->{We simply say ``$f$ is continuous'' if it is continuous at every point in the domain. }\uncover<13->{If $f$ is not continuous at a point $c$ \emph{in the domain}, then we say that $f$ is discontinuous at $c.$ }   
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Week 2}
    We have the usual rules which tell us that sum/product/composition of continuous functions is continuous. \uncover<2->{If $f$ is continuous at $c$ and $f(c) \neq 0,$ then $1/f$ is continuous at $c.$ }\uncover<3->{We had also seen that the square root function is continuous. }\uncover<4->{We now state an important property of continuous functions. }
    \uncover<5->{\begin{defn}[Intermediate Value Property]
        Suppose $f:[a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function. \uncover<6->{Let $u \in \mathbb{R}$ be between $f(a)$ and $f(b).$ }\uncover<7->{Then, there exists $c \in [a, b]$ }\uncover<8->{such that $f(c) = u.$ }
    \end{defn} }
    \uncover<9->{Note carefully that the domain is an interval. }
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Week 2}
    Now, we state another property, called the extreme value theorem.
    \begin{thm}[Extreme value theorem]
        \uncover<2->{Let $f:[a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous. }\uncover<3->{Then, there exist $x_1, x_2 \in [a, b]$ }\uncover<4->{such that }\uncover<5->{
        \begin{equation*} 
            f(x_1) \le f(x) \le f(x_2)
        \end{equation*} }\uncover<6->{for all $x \in [a, b].$ }
    \end{thm}
    \uncover<7->{Note very carefully that the above not only shows that the image of $f$ is bounded }\uncover<8->{but also that the bounds are attained! }\uncover<9->{Note that the domain was a \underline{closed and bounded} interval. }
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Week 2}
    Recall that a (non-empty) set which is bounded above can have many upper bounds. \uncover<2->{However, completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ tells us that there is a \emph{least} upper bound. }\uncover<3->{We had called this the \emph{supremum}. }

    \uncover<4->{Similarly, we had defined \emph{infimum}. }

    \uncover<5->{By abuse of notation, given a function $f:X \to \mathbb{R},$ }\uncover<6->{if the image $f(X) \subset \mathbb{R}$ is bounded above, }\uncover<7->{then the supremum of the image is called the supremum of $f$ \underline{on $X$}. }\\
    \uncover<8->{Analogous comments hold for infimum. }

    \uncover<9->{Thus, what the previous theorem told us was that not only is the image bounded but the supremum and infimum are actually attained. }\uncover<10->{(If the function is continuous and defined on a close and bounded interval, that is.) }
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Week 2}
    \textbf{Non-examples} of the previous theorem:

    \uncover<2->{Consider $f:(0, 1) \to \mathbb{R}$ }\uncover<3->{defined by
    \begin{equation*} 
        f(x) = x.
    \end{equation*} }\uncover<4->{The image is bounded but the infimum/supremum are not attained. }

    \uncover<5->{Consider $f:(0, 1) \to \mathbb{R}$ }\uncover<6->{defined by
    \begin{equation*} 
        f(x) = \dfrac{1}{x}.
    \end{equation*} }\uncover<7->{The image is not bounded above. }\uncover<8->{It is bounded below but the infimum is not attained. }
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Week 2}
    We saw one interesting result that helps simplify our life in some scenarios.
    \begin{thm}[Sequential criterion]
        \uncover<2->{Let $f:A \to \mathbb{R}$ be a function }\uncover<3->{and let $a \in A.$ }\uncover<4->{Then, $f$ is continuous at $a$ iff }\uncover<5->{given any sequence $(a_n)$ {\color{red}in $A$} }\uncover<6->{such that $a_n \to a,$ }\uncover<7->{we have $f(a_n) \to f(a).$ }
    \end{thm}
    \uncover<8->{This makes life simpler because it is sometimes easier to deal with sequences. }\uncover<9->{We had seen an example of this when we proved that a certain oscillatory function does not have a limit. }\uncover<10->{Do you remember which? }
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Week 2}
    Next, we defined derivative. This was also not difficult.
    \begin{defn}[Derivative]
        \uncover<2->{Let $f:(a, b) \to \mathbb{R}$ be a function }\uncover<3->{and let $c \in (a, b).$ }\uncover<4->{$f$ is said to be \emph{differentiable at the point $c$} }\uncover<5->{if the following limit exists: }\uncover<6->{
        \begin{equation*} 
            \lim_{h\to 0}\dfrac{f(c + h) - f(c)}{h}.
        \end{equation*} }\uncover<7->{In such a case, we call the value of the above limit the derivative of $f$ at $c$ }\uncover<8->{and denote it by $f'(c).$ }
    \end{defn}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Week 2}
    We then have the usual rules about product/sum/composition of differentiable functions again being differentiable. \uncover<2->{Of course, we \textbf{don't} have the naïve product rule but rather $(fg)'(c) = f'(c)g(c) + f(c)g'(c).$ }\uncover<3->{We then looked at minima/maxima. }

    \uncover<4->{\begin{defn}[Local maximum]
        Let $f:X \to \mathbb{R}$ be a function \uncover<5->{and let $x_0 \in X.$ }\uncover<6->{Suppose that there is an interval $(c, d) \subset X$ containing $x_0.$ }\uncover<7->{If we have $f(x_0) \ge f(x)$ }\uncover<8->{for all $x \in (c, d),$ }\uncover<9->{then we say that $f$ has a \emph{local maximum} at $x_0.$ }
    \end{defn} }
    \uncover<10->{Of course, we have an analogous definition for minimum. }\uncover<11->{Note that here, we have that $x_0$ is an ``interior point.'' }\uncover<12->{That is, there is an interval \emph{around} $x_0$ contained within the domain. }
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Week 2}
    \begin{thm}[Fermat's Theorem]
        \uncover<2->{If $f:X\to \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable }\uncover<3->{and has a local minimum or maxmimum at a point $x_0 \in X,$ }\uncover<4->{then $f'(x_0) = 0.$ }
    \end{thm}
    \uncover<5->{Once again, note that this only talks about ``interior points.'' }
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Week 2}
    We then saw Rolle's Theorem. Note the hypothesis carefully.
    \begin{thm}[Rolle's Theorem]
        \uncover<2->{Suppose $f:{\color{red}[}a, b{\color{red}]} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a \emph{continuous} function. }\uncover<3->{Further, assume that it is differentiable on $(a, b).$ }\uncover<4->{In this case, if $f(a) = f(b),$ }\uncover<5->{then $f'(c) = 0$ for some $c \in (a, b).$ }
    \end{thm}
    \uncover<6->{Using the above, we have a more general result. }\uncover<7->{\begin{thm}[Mean Value Theorem]
        Let $f$ be continuous and differentiable as above. \uncover<8->{There exists $c \in (a, b)$ }\uncover<9->{such that
        \begin{equation*} 
            f'(c) = \dfrac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}.
        \end{equation*} } 
    \end{thm} }
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Week 2}
    We then saw a theorem which said ``derivatives have IVP.'' TO be more precise:
    \begin{thm}[Darboux's Theorem]
        \uncover<2->{Let $f:(a, b) \to \mathbb{R}$ be a differentiable function. }\uncover<3->{Let $c < d$ be points in $(a, b).$ }\uncover<4->{Let $u$ be between $f'(c)$ and $f'(d).$ }\uncover<5->{Then, there exists $x_0 \in (c, d)$ such that }\uncover<6->{
        \begin{equation*} 
            f'(x_0) = u.
        \end{equation*} }
    \end{thm}
    \uncover<7->{Note that the derivative of a (differentiable) function need not be continuous. }\uncover<8->{We shall see an example in the tutorial today, in fact. }\uncover<9->{However, the above theorem tells us how the derivative can't have ``jump'' discontinuity. }
